Amazon Best Sellers Scraper

Description:

This Python-based scraper is designed to extract detailed information from Amazon's Best Sellers section, focusing on products with discounts greater than 50%. The scraper performs authentication, handles CAPTCHA challenges, and retrieves data for products in 10 different categories. The extracted information is then stored in a structured format (CSV/JSON).

Key Features:

Authentication:

The scraper uses valid Amazon credentials to log in. If a CAPTCHA is encountered, the script will pause and allow the user to complete the CAPTCHA manually before resuming the scraping process.
Data Collection:

Scrape top-selling products in 10 categories (for example: Kitchen, Shoes, Computers, Electronics, etc.).
For each product, collect the following details:
Product Name
Product Price
Product Rating
Product Description

Error Handling:

The scraper includes robust error handling to deal with interruptions, page load issues, or missing data during the scraping process.
Data Storage:

The collected data is stored in either a CSV or JSON file format for easy access and further analysis.
Headless Mode with CAPTCHA Handling:

The scraper runs headlessly (without opening a browser window), but if a CAPTCHA challenge is encountered, the browser window opens for manual interaction. After solving the CAPTCHA, the script resumes from where it left off.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Selenium
ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver (based on browser choice)
WebDriver Manager (optional for automatic driver management)
Pandas (for data storage in CSV format)
JSON (for storing data in JSON format)
Valid Amazon Account Credentials (for authentication)
Technical Specifications:
The script uses Selenium for web automation to interact with Amazonâ€™s pages.
The script performs scraping on the Best Seller's page and navigates to category pages to extract details.
Error handling is implemented using try-except blocks to prevent crashes during scraping and log any issues for troubleshooting.
Data is stored in a structured CSV or JSON format for easy data analysis.
